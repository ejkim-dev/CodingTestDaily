<h1>21. Merge Two Sorted Lists</h1>

_Go to the [test](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)._

Merge two **sorted** linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.


<h3>Example 1:</h3>

![sample1](/src/asset/test_210312_merge_ex1.jpg)

<pre>
<code>
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>
<code>
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<pre>
<code>
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- 100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
